Important Note on Expectations
We would like to set clear expectations upfront. We are not expecting a 100% complete or fully polished application. This assignment is designed to understand how you think, how you approach complex problems, and what you are capable of building within a limited timeframe.

You are strongly encouraged to be resourceful and to use any tools or resources available to you, including generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, documentation, or open-source references. We are interested in how you leverage tools, make decisions, and prioritize features, not just the final output.

Assignment Overview
Project Title: Healthcare Doctor–Patient Translation Web Application

Your task is to design and build a full-stack web application that acts as a real-time translation bridge between a doctor and a patient. This project is intended to evaluate your ability to architect a multi-feature application, integrate AI or LLM APIs, handle audio data, and ship a working, deployed product under time constraints.

Scope & Timeline
Time Allowed: 12 hours

Submission Format: Public GitHub repository and deployed live application

Important: While full completeness is not expected, missing a deployed link or basic documentation may affect evaluation

Core Functionalities (Mandatory)
1. Real-Time Doctor–Patient Translation

Support two roles: Doctor and Patient

Messages typed or spoken by one role should be translated into the selected language of the other role in near real time

2. Text Chat Interface

Clean and intuitive chat UI

Clear visual distinction between Doctor and Patient messages

3. Audio Recording & Storage

Ability to record audio directly from the browser

Recorded audio clips should be visible and playable within the conversation thread

4. Conversation Logging

Log text and audio interactions with timestamps

Conversation history should persist beyond the active session

5. Conversation Search

Ability to search keywords or phrases across logged conversations

Highlight matched text and show surrounding context

6. AI-Powered Summary

Generate a concise summary at any point during or after a conversation

Highlight medically important points such as symptoms, diagnoses, medications, and follow-up actions

Technical Expectations
Full-stack web application (frontend and backend)

AI or LLM integration for translation and summarization

Audio handling and basic storage

Clean, readable, and well-organized code

Mobile-friendly UI

Deployment on a public platform (e.g., Vercel, Render, Railway, etc.)

Submission Requirements
Please submit the following. Partial implementations are acceptable as long as your work is clearly explained.

Public GitHub Repository

Single repository

Clear project structure

README.md including:

Project overview

Features attempted and completed

Tech stack used

AI tools and resources leveraged

Known limitations, trade-offs, or unfinished parts

Deployed Live Link

Application should be accessible, even if partially complete

Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated holistically based on:

Problem-solving approach and prioritization

Code quality and structure

AI and LLM integration decisions

UI clarity and usability

Documentation and communication

Feature completeness is not the sole factor.
